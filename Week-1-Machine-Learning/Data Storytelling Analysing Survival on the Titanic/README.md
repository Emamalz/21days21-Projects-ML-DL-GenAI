# Titanic Survival Prediction 

## Overview
Built a machine learning model to predict Titanic passenger survival using feature engineering, data cleaning, and classification algorithms.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
- Visualisation of survival trends

## Results
- Achieved XX% accuracy on test data
- Insights: Gender and class strongly influenced survival probability
